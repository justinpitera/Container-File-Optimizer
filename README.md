## Project Description 
This product is an application designed to aid software developers by automating the process of containerization. The application allows users to create a container, import files in the container, create systems, and connect systems and containers. The product will then optimize all of the Containerfiles in the system and output these optimizations in a text file. This application consists of three main components: Graphical User Interface, Database, and Optimization.<br>
This product is a Windows form application that was developed in C# using Microsoft .NET. .NET was utilized to create a local database and ADO .NET was used to facilitate all of the interactions between the application and the database. 


## Installation 
This application requires the Microsoft Windows Operating System and the current version of .NET installed. It is recommended to have the latest version of Windows installed to ensure full compatibility. This application takes up 20 MB of storage. Although the size of the database file may grow.<br>
